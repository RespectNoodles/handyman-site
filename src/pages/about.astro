        <p>
          Hi, I'm Cruz — the hands behind the hammer here at Handyman Cruz. I’ve worked in general trades for years, helping clients across town fix, improve, and maintain their homes and spaces. Whether it’s concreting, tiling, light fixtures, or small renovations, I’m passionate about getting it done right the first time.
        </p>

        <p>
          My mission is simple: deliver quality work you can trust, with clear communication and a friendly face. I'm proud to serve homeowners, renters, property managers, and local businesses with a wide range of affordable handyman services.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of work, I enjoy hands-on projects, learning new trade skills, and giving back to the community.
