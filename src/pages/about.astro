        I’m Cruz — a Perth-based handyman focused on reliable workmanship, honest communication, and practical outcomes.
        My background spans repairs, outdoor improvements, and problem-solving jobs where attention to detail matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also bring a strong interest in IT and cybersecurity. That helps me run every project with a clear system: assess,
        communicate, execute, and verify. Clients get predictable service and consistent quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you need maintenance, upgrades, or someone dependable for recurring jobs, my goal is simple: deliver work
        that makes your space better and gives you confidence.
