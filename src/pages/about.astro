      <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
        From battling monsoons in bamboo huts to braving scorching desert builds, my toolbox has clocked more air
        miles than most suitcases. I’m Cruz — a worldly handyman with a rustic soul and a professional edge.

      <p>
        I hammered my very first nail on the red‑dust plains outside Alice Springs, helping my grandfather shore up a
        weather‑worn sheep station fence. The timber was splintered, the sun merciless, but the moment that post hit
        plumb, something inside me clicked into place. That mix of sweat, sawdust, and simple satisfaction sparked a
        lifelong love affair with tools, timber, and the quiet pride of a job well done.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wanderlust would not let me settle. I backpacked through Southeast Asia, where I learned the art of bamboo
        joinery from craftsmen who build entire homes with nothing but hand tools and ingenuity. In the Philippines, I
        helped reconstruct typhoon‑damaged roofs, balancing on rafters while coconut palms bowed in the wind — the
        locals joked I was part monkey, part carpenter. In Nepal, altitude became my adversary as we rebuilt mountain
        tea‑houses, each plank hauled up by mule or on weary shoulders. Those thin‑air lessons forged patience thicker
        than hardwood.
      </p>

      <p>
        Europe called next. I restored century‑old shutters in the lavender fields of Provence, matching faded cedar
        with custom stains until the grain popped like art. In the Scottish Highlands, I wrestled stone walls back
        together, each granite block a puzzle piece holding generations of stories. Evenings were spent trading jokes
        with crofters over drams of whisky — proof that a good laugh is universal mortar.
      </p>

      <p>
        I thought the Aussie Outback harsh until I landed a contract on an offshore rig in the North Sea. Imagine
        changing corroded fittings while icy spray needles your face and the deck lurches like a roller‑coaster.
        Forget gym memberships — torqueing bolts against gale‑force winds chisels muscles and grit in equal measure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Those adventures sharpened more than my chisels. They taught me that craftsmanship is a global language and
        professionalism a universal currency. Every culture emphasised two truths:
        <strong class="text-blue-400">measure twice, cut once</strong> and
        <strong class="text-blue-400">treat clients as neighbours</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Perth eventually lured me home with its endless skies and community spirit. Today, Handyman Cruz blends worldly
        skill with down‑to‑earth service. From recycled‑timber fences that whisper stories of sustainability, to
        bespoke blinds finished with a varnish recipe I learned in a Croatian boatyard, my portfolio is equal parts
        craft and creativity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Safety is my North Star. I’m fully insured, continuously up‑skilling, and I approach
        every site — whether a backyard deck or a high‑ceiling art install — with the same disciplined checklist I used
        offshore. Your home is your harbour; my job is to keep it shipshape.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I’m not on the tools, you’ll find me volunteering at local men’s sheds, mentoring teens on practical trade
        skills, or scouring salvage yards for timber with “character.” My workshop radio is permanently tuned to classic
        rock, and I still sharpen chisels by hand because patience leaves the cleanest edge.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, whether you need a quick fix that won’t fall apart in a fortnight, a creative twist on a tired patio, or a
        full‑scale renovation steered with steady hands, I’m your guy. Let’s craft something solid, sustainable, and
        story‑worthy — together.

        continents.
