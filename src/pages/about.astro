    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">My Journey</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      I’ve travelled the world, hammer in hand. From rebuilding hurricane-struck rooftops in rural Fiji to restoring stonework in a remote Turkish village, I’ve worked across cultures and climates. These hands have scraped, lifted, cut, and carved stories into every beam and board I’ve touched.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      I've laboured in 40-degree heat with no power tools, built fences from scratch in South American hillsides, and learned the art of old-school tradecraft from seasoned builders in Eastern Europe. But it wasn’t until I returned home that I found my true purpose: using my global experience to help everyday Aussies with reliable, down-to-earth handyman services.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Handyman Cruz isn’t just a name — it’s my promise. A promise that every project, no matter the size, will be approached with heart, honesty, and handcrafted care. I’m not just here to get the job done; I’m here to make your space feel stronger, safer, and more ‘you’.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      If you're looking for someone who listens first, works cleanly, shows up on time, and truly gives a damn — I’d love to help.
    </p>
