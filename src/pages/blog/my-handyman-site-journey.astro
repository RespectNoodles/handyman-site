  <h1>From Wrench to Web: Building HandymanCruz.com</h1>
  
  <p>
    Let’s be honest — I never thought I’d go from fixing fences to fixing broken layouts, but here we are. HandymanCruz.com was born out of a simple idea: “Maybe people would hire me more if I actually had a website.” Seems innocent enough, right?
  </p>

  <p>
    So I dove in. No fancy web design degree, just good ol’ Google, a bunch of late nights, and a growing pile of “why won’t this button center?” moments. I picked <strong>Astro</strong> (because it sounded cool) and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> (because every tutorial told me to). Spoiler: both were worth it — once I stopped crying.
  </p>

  <p>
    I learned fast: static site generators don’t mean it’s easy. I had to figure out how to deploy to Cloudflare, manage DNS (shout out to the two-day nameserver crisis), and hand-craft every section — from quote forms to testimonials. I even designed my business cards and added them to the site like some kind of digital trophy.
  </p>

  <p>
    The highlight? Rebuilding the homepage to actually look good. I drew inspiration from sites like <a href="https://hollywoods.net.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hollywoods</a>, then rewrote every section to match that clean, rustic, professional vibe. A gradient hero here, a parallax scroll there, and a bit of wood texture for good measure — job done.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the end, I didn’t just build a website — I built something I’m proud of. Something that shows who I am, what I do, and why I care about quality. Whether you’re here to hire me or just snoop around (it's okay, I’d do the same), welcome to the Cruz Shop.
